# Gotta Dodge 'Em All! Game Project

Programmed a game in C using an Atmega 1284p microcontroller.

**Game Description:** Dodge all the incoming dots heading straight at you (the player)! If you collide with any incoming dot, you lose and the entire LED matrix will illuminate. In this game, we have three difficulty levels: easy, medium, and a hard mode. As you rise up in difficulty levels, the incoming dots will move even faster making it harder to dodge. When you press the easy mode, a green LED will light up. When you press the medium mode, a yellow LED will light up. And when you press the hard mode, a red LED will light up. There are two buttons (connected to port A0 and A1 for moving the player up and down).

# Hardware used:
* Atmega1284p microcontroller
* 8x8 LED Dot matrix
* Buttons
